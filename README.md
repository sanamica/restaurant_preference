# Exploring Restaurants Based Upon Neighborhood Income

This project is based upon personal experience of trying out new restaurants and observing how even highly reviewed restaurant could have bad services. I wondered if we could use data science techniques to trace any relationship between neighbor income and restaurant attributes.  Whether inequality in society impacts restaurant business or not?
For this project, I choose to look at data on restaurants in a different location and I got that data from Yelp data challenge 2019. For data on income and location, I accessed the Census API.

Why look at the relationship between income level and restaurants? and Who can benefit?
If we can navigate the relation between neighborhood income and restaurant preferences, it will be useful for restaurant owners as well as policymakers.

Restaurant Owners 
It would open up avenues to predict what kind of restaurant will succeed in a certain location? what features restaurant owners should priorities for a certain locality? 

Policy Makers
 For policymakers, it would open up one more avenue to analyze the influence of income segregation, especially in low-income areas.

Restaurant Customers
The location-based recommender can be used by people to decide which restaurant they want to visit in a particular area.
